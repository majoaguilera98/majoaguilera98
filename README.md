## Hi there 👋

💡 About me
Hi! I’m María José Aguilera González, passionate about innovation, data-driven decision making, and digital transformation.
I currently work at Ruma Desarrollos, where I lead projects that connect strategy, technology, and process improvement — integrating tools like Zoho, analytics dashboards, and automation workflows to turn ideas into measurable impact.

🎯 Background:
• Industrial Engineering + Data Analysis

• Experience in process optimization, business intelligence, and system implementation (Zoho One ecosystem)

• Ongoing projects in digital innovation, KPI tracking, and EOS management systems

🌱 Always learning: Python, SQL, visualization, and automation — building smarter workflows one dataset at a time.
